            "content": "With 1.7 million bitcoins left to be created, the mining race is on. Some fall, while others rise, gaining ever greater power. Today, five mining pools control over 85% of the total bitcoin mining power. Who are they? Why did this happen? And what are the risks of the concentration of bitcoin mining power? Two Mining Pools Control Half of Bitcoin’s Hash Rate The landscape of the bitcoin mining industry is different from where it was just two years ago. Having undergone major geopolitical changes and mining pool liquidity crises, the bitcoin mining sector has changed. It is no longer about independent miners. Now it is centralized mining pools, which play the most significant role in the bitcoin mining industry. In the first month of 2023, five bitcoin mining pools produced over 86% of the global bitcoin hash rate, a measure of computing power on the Bitcoin network. This is nearly 20% more than a year ago, when five leaders contributed to 67% of the total BTC mining power. Source: Mempool.space Two leading pools, Foundry USA and AntPool, controlled 52.3% of Bitcoin’s hash rate over January 2023. Both created 2,432 bitcoin blocks over the first month, 1534 and 898, respectively. Institutional grade mining pool Foundry USA, a Digital Currency Group (DCG) subsidiary and the world’s largest BTC mining pool, contributed 33.04% of the total BTC hash rate. This is 87% more than the New York-based company’s contribution a year ago. Foundry has created 12,733 bitcoin blocks over the past year or an average of 34.8 blocks per day. Since miners are rewarded 6.25 BTC per block until the next bitcoin halving, Foundry USA pool miners, on average, shared 217.5 bitcoins worth nearly $5 million at a current price of $22.8K each day. The second largest mining pool AntPool contributed to a 19.3% network share over the past month. The mining division of Chinese crypto mining manufacturer Bitmain increased its BTC mining power share by 23.3% compared to the same time a year ago. AntPool mined 8963 bitcoin blocks within the past 12 months. On average, it’s 24.5 blocks or 153 bitcoins or $3.5 million in earnings daily. Source: Mempool.space Foundry USA and AntPool grew at the expense of their smaller competitors, whose mining capacity has gradually decreased or changed slightly over the year. What Led to Mining Pool Market Centralization? Market conditions have been difficult for bitcoin miners during the massive cryptocurrency market downturn of 2022. First of all, the value of bitcoin dropped by more than 70% from its all-time high price of $68K. The bitcoin hash rate then kept steadily growing and reached an all-time high of 39.3T on January 29, 2023. The increasing hash rate means more difficult bitcoin mining in which miners must work harder to remain profitable unless the price changes significantly. Source: Btc.com Finally, the factor of energy consumption and electricity prices must be considered. Fueled by Russia’s war in Ukraine, energy prices skyrocketed automatically, leading to higher expenses and lower profits for bitcoin miners. With the cost of production increasing while the bitcoin price decreased, bitcoin miners, including the three largest US-based mining firms, Core Scientific, Marathon Digital Holdings, and Riot Blockchain, faced huge losses and were reported to sell more bitcoin than they mined. Numerous miners spent 135% of their newly mined coins daily in mid-November 2022, Glassnode reported. To punctuate this point, #Bitcoin miners are currently spending at a rate of 135% of the daily issued coins. This implies that in aggregate, miners are distributing all ~900 freshly minted $BTC , as well as an additional 315 $BTC from their treasuries each day. pic.twitter.com/RV4QqXDWmF — glassnode (@glassnode) November 18, 2022 Poolin, the fifth biggest bitcoin ming pool at the start of 2022, acknowledged liquidity issues and froze withdrawals back in September 2022. Its computational power declined by 86% through the year, from 11.57% in January 2022 to 1.57% in January 2023. Smaller mining pools, like Btc.com or Braiins Pool, gradually decreased operations. Meanwhile, mining giant Foundry significantly strengthened its positions, which it gained after China’s crypto ban in 2021 when local BTC miners massively transferred their devices and operations into the United States. US Leads Bitcoin Hash Rate Market For years China acted as the home base for most BTC mining operations. But since the country’s mining crackdown, the United States quickly established itself as the world’s biggest bitcoin mining hub. According to the Cambridge Center for Alternative Finance data, US miners contributed 37.84% to the average monthly BTC hash rate at the beginning of 2022. China’s nearest competitor accounted for a lower hash rate share of 21.11%. Source: Ccaf.io The United States currently hosts the biggest mining pool. It also hosts major institutional-grade mining companies like Marathon Digital Holdings (which, on average, mined 15.3 bitcoins per day in December 2022), Riot Blockchain, and Hut 8 Mining. Possible Risks of Bitcoin Mining Power Concentration As bitcoin was invented as an alternative to centralized money, any centralization is often considered a risk to the network’s core principles and security. One hotly debated issue is Bitcoin’s vulnerability to a “51% attack.” According to centralization critics , anyone controlling the majority (more than 50%) of the BTC hash rate can manipulate the network. They can censor the confirmation of new transactions, halt them, and even alter the blockchain. 51% of attacks are usually expensive and difficult to maintain, but they may cause huge reputational damage to Bitcoin. Since its early days more than a decade ago, Bitcoin has never suffered a security breach or attack of the majority. On the other hand, the Bitcoin community questions the potential threat of power concentration among a few mining pools that are nothing more than clusters of separate miners. Miners combine their computational power to increase the chances of winning a block and then share the reward. However, the growing competition among mining pools leads to them decreasing their fees, eventually reaching similar levels. Theoretically, this leaves mining pools open to miner migration from one pool to another. According to crypto miners, switching between pools helps to “ensure adequate decentralization and hedge against pool-derived 51% attack.” Closing Thoughts When Bitcoin and its white paper first appeared in 2008, it was built on the concept of a decentralized network and accessibility to anyone. More than a decade later, statistics show it may have become centralized. This means it is dominated by large players, not only large mining pools but also by large bitcoin holders amd crypto exchanges. Theoretically, the concentration of power could make Bitcoin susceptible to risks such as a 51% attack. It can also imply that most gains from further adoption could fall disproportionately to fewer participants.

            "content": "Emin Gün Sirer , creator of the Avalanche Consensus protocol and Ava Labs CEO, believes that there is one very straightforward method to spot a long-standing cryptocurrency project. On Feb. 7 ​​Sirer discussed blockchain venture capital and crypto regulation in a fireside chat with MarketAcross chief operations officer Itai Elizur at the Web3 builder-focused event, Building Blocks 23. During the discussion, the Avalanche founder pointed out the crucial role of “staying power” in the crypto industry, condemning players that run from one project to another or jump into “every single new coin offering” in the hopes that they will go up. According to ​​Sirer, the desire to reap quick profits from crypto will only turn the space into a terrible thing, and VCs are not to blame. “I will tell you who’s to blame; it’s us,” ​​Sirer declared, urging the community to support solid crypto initiatives and avoid scammy projects with a short life span. He then shared his “very simple test” of how to spot long-standing projects in crypto and stay away from those who make grand promises and then disappear. “So look at the team behind any project, look at their staying power,” Ava Labs CEO said, adding that the regulating jurisdiction of a cryptocurrency firm provides one of the most important hints about its long-term capabilities. He stated: Crypto firms headquartered in the Silicon Valley are likely to do “pure tech play,” Sirer argued. “They will do the one tech trick pony then they will disappear,” he noted. Ava Labs CEO went on to say that long-lasting crypto projects are more likely to be headquartered in New York, “where the assets are” and that are integrated with financial institutions. “That's where we need to go,” Sirer stated, stressing that there are some people who devote their lives and careers to make things work in crypto. “VCs, of course, love the short lifespan projects,” he added. Related: New York Assembly introduces crypto payments bill for fines, taxes Additionally, Sirer emphasized the importance of always growing the space, even during a bear market. “In fact, I happen to like bear markets more. It's much more fun to be building when everyone is more rational,” the executive stated. The latest remarks by Sirer add some new ideas about the executive's view of the cryptocurrency market. In 2020, Sirer argued that more than 95% of cryptocurrencies were nothing but scams . He also criticized use cases of new crypto initiatives, stating that Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency to offer a peer-to-peer online payment method.",

            "content": "Metamask Snaps objectives to assist in a ‘multichain future,’ permitting the Ethereum-based wallet service to support non-native blockchains and tokens for the Web3 economy. Details of the current in-development addition to Metamask’s growing community were unpacked at the StarkWare Sessions occasion in Tel Aviv, Israel, in Feb. 2023. Speaking to Cointelegraph Magazine editor Andrew Fenton, Alex Jupiter, the senior item supervisor at Metamask Snaps, exposed information about possible blockchain synergies. The last 18 months have actually seen the advancement of Snaps accelerate after the success of Metamask Swaps, which brought token swap performance to the service’s native web browser extension. As Jupiter discussed, interoperability is ending up being significantly crucial in the blockchain area: “Metamask has historically been an Ethereum wallet. We need to start moving beyond that. The multichain future is very clear.” Snaps objectives to produce a permissionless community where designers can extend Metamask in any method they desire. Jupiter states the group is attempting to produce an environment where designers can utilize different application programs user interfaces (APIs) from various blockchains to bring extra choices to a user’s core wallet experience. Related: The blue fox: DeFi’s increase and the birth of Metamask Institutional MetaMask explains Snaps as a system that enables designers to extend the abilities of the wallet extension. A breeze is a program that runs in a separated environment that can personalize a user’s wallet experience. The possibilities are comprehensive, with a breeze permitting the addition of brand-new APIs to MetaMask, multi-blockchain procedure support in addition to the capability to customize existing MetaMask performance utilizing external APIs. According to Jupiter, Snaps need to be able to incorporate with many blockchain procedures: “Technically it’s possible for us to incorporate all of them. I’m sure there’s going to be an edge case. We have managed to extend Bitcoin, managed to extend to StarkNet. So it should be possible with any of them.” As Jupiter discusses, MetaMask has actually currently developed a Bitcoin (BTC) Snap that enables users to connect with its procedure from the wallet extension. This is a harder proposal than incorporating Ethereum virtual machine-compatible chains like Polygon, however completion outcome is a highly-interoperable wallet extension throughout the broad blockchain-based community: “It basically means that you don’t need to go anywhere else and MetaMask can almost be the core of your Web3 experience.” Improving Web3 performance is another driving consider the advancement of Snaps. Despite onboarding countless users to Web3 through MetaMask’s tools, Jupiter states that basic actions like signing deals can still be precarious: “People have problems in terms of knowing if they’re signing a transaction whether it’s safe.” Jupiter thinks Snaps can resolve this location, permitting 3rd parties to produce deal insights and possibly caution users of signing suspicious deals with undesirable repercussions. MetaMask Snaps is presently readily available in the designer variation of MetaMask Flask. Jupiter states the goal is to have Snaps incorporated with the primary MetaMask by the end of 2023.

            "description": "With blockchain, even people who don’t trust each other can use it as a trustworthy central authority that cannot be corrupted or manipulated",
            "content": "For decades, the bulk of countries across the African continent have been part of the impoverished global south. Often defined by war, corruption, and extreme poverty levels, the question of how to help Africa advance and take their place among the first-world nations of the world has been asked by countless people inside and outside of Africa for a long time. But since the birth of cryptocurrency in 2009, many Africans have successfully used digital currencies and the decentralised blockchain technology that they’re based on to better their lives, escape poverty, and overcome the common barriers they often face when it comes to things like opening a bank account and moving money across borders. Did you know that 57 per cent of Africans are unbanked and don’t own a bank account? Crazy, right? Between 2021 and 2022, funding for blockchain projects across Africa surged from just over $5 million to $91 million. The reasons for this boom are the lack of conventional banks we’re used to in the west and a huge population of over 1.216 billion (most of whom are unbanked, as mentioned above). Despite being a relatively new technology, b lockchain is booming across Africa and increasingly becoming a staple technology for many everyday Africans . Many are comparing the surge in blockchain to the rise of the internet in Africa in the 1990s and the many opportunities that came with it. In particular, blockchain and crypto have become hugely popular across Sub-Saharan Africa in countries such as Nigeria, South Africa, Kenya, and Ghana. These nations have witnessed a fast rise in people being able to access cryptocurrency and flawlessly pay for it using blockchain technology. In a similar view that the rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is viewed, many people around the world have allowed the positively disruptive qualities of blockchain technology and been fascinated by how fast it’s been adapted to Africa and included in vast swathes of society there. How Blockchain Works & Why It’s Fitted in So Well to Africa The simplest way to explain blockchain is as a decentralised digital ledger that operates cryptographic algorithms to affirm the creation and transfer of digitally characterised data over a peer-to-peer network. It’s unbiased and exceptionally trustworthy. With blockchain, even people who don’t trust each other can use it as a trustworthy central authority that cannot be corrupted or manipulated. So, naturally, it can play a huge role in various facets of African society. One that is often marred by state-level corruption. The Common Currency Idea in Africa There are 54 countries in Africa, most of which have their own national currencies. For decades, the idea of a common currency that could be used across the entire continent has been a nightmarish process because various factions hold different levels of political power and interference from old colonial powers. To put it bluntly, forming a common alliance in Africa is a long and challenging process due to the various divides, cultural differences, and prior or ongoing wars and conflicts. But with blockchain, the solution could be very close. The recent establishment of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCTA) aims to unite more than 1.3 billion individuals with a merged gross domestic product (GDP) worth more than $3.4 trillion. The idea of AfCTA is to bring together African people from across the continent and disregard any quarrels stemming from their political and religious beliefs. Many countries across modern Africa are being held back from joining the ranks of first-world nations by a myriad of problems ranging from corruption and a lack of basic healthcare to the absence of mechanised farming, war, poverty, and unemployment, to name just a few. In other countries worldwide, blockchain technology has already been utilised to an extremely effective degree to overhaul industries ranging from farming and aviation to tourism and even national defence. In Africa, it could potentially revolutionise the conventional African systems, bureaucracy, and administration that many Africans are dissatisfied with and distrustful of. In addition, blockchain could also have the potential to form a bond between African countries that currently have a cold relationship with one another, thus forming a feeling of unity and assisting with the formation of free trade agreements via regional currencies, thus promoting intra-continental trade in turn . And it’s not just me who thinks so. The boom in blockchain and crypto adoption across the continent is a testament to how many Africans feel the same. In particular, the surge in the value of cryptocurrencies in 2021 brought the attention of many Africans to the world of crypto. Eventually, it led to countless people and businesses beginning to invest in it and the groundbreaking blockchain technology that cryptocurrencies are founded. Sadly, as with any new technology, some Africans were caught off guard in their initial investing stage and ended up using scam platforms that ripped them off. If you feel unsure you might end up in a similar situation, do not worry! We have a number of recommendations for platforms that will not only keep you safe but allow you to upscale your trading journey. A perfect example is BitcoinUp , a combination of data protection and valuable trading tools Many experts predict that this is no fad and that the interest and widespread adoption of crypto across Africa will be a defining feature of the continent for a long time into the future. Major Businesses Utilizing Blockchain Across Africa Whilst we’ve talked about the impact of everyday Africans investing in blockchain-based cryptocurrencies, it’s time to talk about the major businesses that equally utilised the groundbreaking technology across the African continent. Most interestingly, an increasing number of banking and financial companies across Africa are becoming more decentralised, such as: All of these banks have taken steps to develop and use an encrypted, secure, distributed database. Those private and not public banks use a private blockchain, whereas the latter use a public one. And whilst all of these banks are from South Africa, it’s one of the most developed countries on the continent; there are also some solid examples from other African countries like Kenya. Just take the introduction of BitPese, for example. Bitepese, a money remittance platform that converts cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and Bitcoin to the local African currency without requiring intermediaries or third parties, is rapidly becoming popular across Kenya. Plus, Kenya has recently made use of a blockchain-based smart platform for the country’s healthcare sector. This allows all Kenyan hospitals to utilise a hub that monitors data like the use of public resources and hospital management, thus fighting corruption and streamlined interconnectivity between different hospitals. A joint Bahamian and Kenyan firm called BlockchainRaise took advantage of blockchain to develop the first security token platform to tokenise assets quickly and securely. The tokenisation process sees physical assets transformed into digital assets on the blockchain. The process makes it streamlined and flawless to protect and maintain accurate records of real estate ownership, titles, commodities and more. And in Nigeria, there are plans for a national digital currency called eNaira, and the country has drafted in experts from Bitt Inc. to develop it properly. Rwanda has also developed a decentralised project in the land development side of the country. It’s called Bitland, and it utilises the Ethereum blockchain to safeguard land ownership by making land details available to the Rwandan public. Rwanda has also seen successful partnerships with the likes of Wisekey and Microsoft, both giant companies that are keen on forming blockchain-based initiatives in the country. In Ethiopia, the national minister for education recently announced that the country would form a blockchain-based database to securely and accurately store school students’ identities and keep track of their academic performance. And last but least, the Central Africa Republic actually made Bitcoin a form of legal tender across the country. Amazingly, the CAR made history by becoming the world’s second country to do so after El Salvador. Crypto Startups in Africa Regarding global crypto markets, Africa is in third place regarding those which are growing at the fastest rate, and it’s having no issues attracting major investors from around the world. Today, Africa is the third fastest-growing cryptocurrency market globally, steadily attracting large investments. As I mentioned at the beginning of this article, the funding for blockchain startups and projects across Africa surged from just over $5 million to $91 million. Most funding goes to countries like Nigeria, Kenya, South Africa and Seychelles. But from all the funds raised, the majority is going towards startups and businesses in the Fintech sector, accounting for around 53 per cent of all blockchain-related funding. Here are some examples: There has also been a boom in the spread of mobile tech across Africa, which has thus led to a surge in the use of digital payment systems. More than 450 million Africans don’t have a bank account, so the blockchain can make a tremendous change by providing an unrivalled and unseen level of financial inclusion across the continent. Peer-to-peer platforms like Paxful and Localbitcoins are solid examples of blockchain-based technologies that allow millions of ordinary Africans to gain access to a huge range of financial services they would never have been able to use. Final Thoughts: Is Africa’s Future Decentralized? The adoption of mobile technology, the chance to access the global banking system and escape poverty, and a generally tech-savvy population across the continent have made Africa an ideal territory for adopting blockchain and cryptocurrencies. Plus, as the global financial markets become increasingly unstable, more people in Africa are increasingly turning to blockchain-based cryptocurrencies to become financially secure. The proliferation of blockchain-based technologies and companies across Africa shows us that this is a continent on which any crypto enthusiast should keep an eye because Africa’s future could indeed lie with blockchain.

            "content": "A fashion executive in Hong Kong was duped out of $764,000 in a kitten sale scam, authorities said. The 58-year-old was told to transfer bitcoin for delivery and insurance fees, SCMP reported. She sent the scammer money via 40 cryptocurrency transactions over five months, the outlet wrote. Thanks for signing up! Access your favorite topics in a personalized feed while you’re on the go. download the app A fashion executive in Hong Kong who thought she was adopting a kitten from Thailand was tricked into giving scammers more than $764,000 in Bitcoin, local authorities said on Wednesday. The would-be cat adopter, a 58-year-old vice-president of a fashion company, believed she had contacted someone looking to give away a three-month-old kitten, The South China Morning Post reported. She got in touch online with the unnamed person in April and continued communicating with them over WhatsApp, per the outlet. The executive was told she could receive the kitten for free, but that she would have to pay transport and insurance fees via cryptocurrency, per a case briefing the the Hong Kong Police Force sent to Insider. She complied, opening a cryptocurrency account and sending the funds to the accused scammer’s e-wallet, the authorities said. Then, the woman was fed a tall tale that the cat had died during the shipping process. At the same time, another unnamed individual posing as a foreign bank employee contacted her, saying she would be compensated for the cat’s death with an insurance payout of around $150,000, police said, per the briefing. There was just one catch: The executive would have to make another payment, this time as a guarantee or administration fee, according to police. She followed the instructions, and by the time she realized the entire interaction was a scam, she’d bought $764,574 worth of cryptocurrency and sent it all to the fraudster, the authorities said. The total sum was transferred over 40 Bitcoin transactions between July and November. It was only in January that the executive thought something was amiss and reported her case to the police, the SCMP reported, citing an anonymous source familiar with the matter. No one has been arrested in connection to the case yet, police said. Crypto scams have surged worldwide in the last few years, with losses in 2021 totaling almost 60 times that of losses recorded in 2018, the Federal Trade Commission reported in June. Scammers made off with around $1 billion in crypto in 2021 alone, per the FTC. Blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis reported a higher estimate for that year, saying $14 billion was taken by crypto scammers in 2021. Pets are often in the mix, too. In April, New Zealand authorities warned of scammers selling puppies using photos they found online, asking potential buyers to transfer more than $1,200 in crypto for purchasing, transport, vaccination, or insurance fees. In 2018, Bitcoin scammers targeted owners of lost dogs in North Carolina, demanding ransoms for the animals when they didn’t have the pets in their possession. Publisher",

            "content": "While commercials from crypto companies were a common sight during the NFL’s final game last year, Super Bowl LVII is shaping up to be an advertising desert for the digital asset industry. When the Los Angeles Rams took on the Cincinnati Bengals in Super Bowl LVI, the year’s biggest sports broadcast featured numerous advertisements from some of crypto’s biggest exchanges, including the now-bankrupt FTX as well as companies like Coinbase and Crypto.com. Etoro also advertised itself as a premier venue for trading stocks and crypto, its ad depicting a trader launching skyward after they signed up for the service. And a commercial from Budweiser paid homage to the Nouns DAO NFT collection, showcasing the project’s iconic glasses overlaying a classical painted portrait. Select crypto companies shelled out millions of dollars to put their companies on display to the masses, hoping to stand out amid a budding industry. And Over 112 million viewers tuned in to watch football’s big game last year, according to the NFL . Notably, advertisements from FTX and Coinbase were accompanied by Bitcoin giveaways, and \"Curb Your Enthusiasm\" star Larry David was the central figure in FTX’s spot, which culminated in the comedian responding \"Ehh...\" when shown the exchange’s app. Even though FTX didn’t trim its headcount prior to the exchange’s collapse, both Coinbase and Crypto.com slimmed their rosters as digital assets came under strain last summer following the implosion of the Terra ecosystem. And as layoffs began mounting across the industry, CEO of cryptocurrency exchange Binance Changpeng Zhao specifically referenced passing on ads for the Super Bowl as he said the company was still hiring in June. It was not easy saying no to Super bowl ads, stadium naming rights, large sponsor deals a few months ago, but we did. Today, we are hiring for 2000 open positions for #Binance . pic.twitter.com/n24nrUik8O — CZ 🔶 Binance (@cz_binance) June 15, 2022 Even though crypto prices have drawn down drastically since Bitcoin clung to around $42,000 during the last Super Bowl, a couple of companies are poised to represent the digital assets space as the Kansas City Chiefs get ready to face off against the Philadelphia Eagles on Sunday. Web3 company Limit Break is set to run an advertisement during the big game’s first commercial break, where it plans to give away thousands of its Dragon series NFTs to showcase the company’s free-to-own NFT model designed for gaming. The interactive advertisement will feature a QR code that serves as part of viewers’ introduction to the DigiDaigaku universe, similar to how Coinbase’s ad from last year directed viewers to its website through a bouncing QR code reminiscent of the retro DVD logo. Hopefully, this website doesn’t crash. Coinbase commercial. Crashed the app pic.twitter.com/grKaTmXUbW — Jason Palatsky (@JasonPalatsky) February 14, 2022 In Canada, crypto exchange Bitbuy will return for the second year in a row, but the company is changing its tune. While the company said that its central focus last year was missed opportunities, this time it's basing its message around trust. To get its point across, the company is doubling the length of its commercial, extending the ad to a full minute. It’s also swapping the NBA’s Kyle Lowry for Scottie Barnes, the league’s most recent Rookie of the Year. Turbotax will also again reference crypto in its upcoming commercial. Last year’s ad included a crypto trader as one of its prospective customers, and it will do so again this Super Bowl, this time with the addition of a Jason Sudeikis cameo. The executive vice president of ad sales for Fox Sports, Mark Evans, said that there will be no representation for crypto companies at the upcoming Super Bowl itself, according to the Associated Press . Fox Sports did not immediately respond to Decrypt ’s requests for comment. A spokesperson for Limit Break said that it’s possible the company’s spot was classified as a gaming advertisement, despite the firm being oriented around blockchain technology. Limit Break’s CEO Gabriel Leydon was previously the CEO of Machine Zone in 2016, when it sponsored an ad for its Mobile Strike game featuring Arnold Schwarzenegger.

            "content": "A Missed Opportunity While China moves forward with its CBDC efforts, it still imposes a complete ban on all cryptocurrency-related operations. Huang Yiping, former advisor to China’s central bank, suggests that the Beijing government should reconsider its strict cryptocurrency embargo. He believes that the ban on crypto-related activities may result in missed opportunities to innovate in cutting-edge technologies. Potential Benefits and Risks Huang sees immense potential in researching blockchain technology. And advocates for a thorough examination of the possible long-term advantages of cryptocurrencies for China. He acknowledges that there are also numerous hazards involved. As a developing country, China faces a challenge in finding a way to maintain stability and control over cryptocurrencies. Yet, eventually, an effective strategy may still need to be established. Apparently, China is starting to tax #crypto at 20%. This could indicate that instead of pursuing a heavy-handed ban policy they could be moving towards a just tax it policy. Potentially HUGE is China shows back up in a big way to #bitcoin ! — Lark Davis (@TheCryptoLark) January 30, 2023 Underground Mining in China Sponsored Sponsored Data from the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance (CCAF) shows that 20% of all bitcoin hash rates came from China between September 2021 and January 2022. This reveals a sizable underground mining sector in the nation, with miners becoming more secure and satisfied with the security provided by local proxy services as the ban took effect. Cryptocurrency in China: From Restrictions to Innovation The history of bitcoin mining in China dates back to 2009, when the world’s first cryptocurrency was introduced. Since then, China has become a hub for bitcoin mining due to its cheap electricity and large amounts of computing power. Despite this, the Chinese government has taken an antagonistic approach to cryptocurrencies, and in September 2021, it imposed a complete ban on all cryptocurrency-related activities, citing concerns about the potential for illegal activities and the disruption of the nation’s financial stability. Sponsored Sponsored Complex and Shifting The history of cryptocurrency in China is somewhat complex, as the government has taken a shifting approach over the years. Initially, China was relatively open to cryptocurrencies, and even home to some of the world’s largest bitcoin exchanges. /Related More Articles Markets News Report Lido Liquid Staking Platform Hits 5M ETH Milestone Ahead of Reward Withdrawal Upgrade Feb 07, 2023 25 mins ago Markets News Report DeFi Exploiter Drains Over $180,000 From CoW Swap DEX Feb 07, 2023 1 hour ago Markets News Report Is Bangkok, Thailand Becoming Asia’s Next Crypto Hub?

Despite the government’s restrictions, the use of cryptocurrencies in China continues to grow , with many people turning to cryptocurrencies as a way to protect their wealth from the depreciation of the yuan. The Ban in 2021 Sponsored Sponsored In September 2021, the Chinese government banned all cryptocurrency-related operations, citing disturbance to the nation’s economic and financial stability and serving as a haven for criminal activity. Huang Yiping served on the Monetary Policy Committee at the People’s Bank of China from 2015 to 2018 and is currently a professor of finance and economics at the National School of Development at Peking University. The Future of Fintech in China In a lecture in December, Huang expressed his concerns about the state of fintech in China. He acknowledged the short-term viability of the cryptocurrency ban, but stressed the importance of long-term consideration. The Beijing government banned industry activity due to concerns about illegal use.

This has raised concerns that China may be isolating itself from the global financial market.
